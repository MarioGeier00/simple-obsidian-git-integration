# Simple Obsidian Git Plugin

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for a seamingless synchronization of the obsidian vault using [Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/). It is based on the work of https://github.com/noradroid/obsidian-git-integration.

It requires Git to be installed in the local system and only works on desktop.

## Features

- Integrate with Obsidian UI in the left ribbon bar with a download (pull) and upload (push) button.
- Uses the `git` command line tool to pull and push changes, so no setup is required.
- Warns when closing obsidian if there are unsynchronised changes.
- Automatically notifies about changes from the remote repository when the vault is opened.
